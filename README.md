System Analysis and Design 22EW5

In the DriverPass project, the client is Liam, the owner of DriverPass. He wanted me to design a website that provides additional training for automobile drivers. The idea is for users to be able to take classes, practice tests online, and schedule on-the-road training.
I feel I was able to thinkk through the process clearly and concisely for all system users.
If I could choose one part to revise, I would change the login process. In revamping the login process, I would provide the option to enable multifactor identification and a lockout process if the user entered the wrong credentials three times in a row.
During system design, I tried to listen to the SME team and determine the best methods for meeting the needs of each user. It is essential to consider the user’s needs when designing because the system could be useless if the project isn’t developed with the user in mind. Generally, there is more than one way to meet the users’ needs. Taking a step back may sometimes be necessary to ensure all of the system criteria have been met.
When designing the software, I had a meeting with the SMEs to ask questions and determine how the system should work and what the users see as challenges. Then developed a plan and met again with the team to ensure I understood the criteria needed. Once I have approval, I will begin documenting and mapping out the design for the system for development.
